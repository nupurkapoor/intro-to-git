Intro to Git
======================

The slides from the original presentation can be found [here](http://nupurkapoor.github.io/intro-to-git/#/). This presentation was put together for Women Who Code DC's Intro to Git session.

This presentation was created for Women Who Code DC's [Intro to Git meetup.] (http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-DC/events/210383992/). It will introduce you to Git, a version control system. This presentation is perfect for beginners as we'll show you the tool many developers use to collaborate and back up code. If you're a developer and you are not using a version control system, you should come out too as it's an absolute must for a developer's workflow.
